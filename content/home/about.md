Welcome to the **TEKNE Club's Website!** We are a group of students who are passionate about everything related to IT. Our meetings are held in **University of Bouira "Akli Mohand Oulhadj"**. During our meetings, we work on projects, discuss new technologies, and learn from each other. Whether you are just starting out in programming or have experience under your belt, you are welcome to join us. We have members with a range of skill levels and are always looking for new people to collaborate with. If you are interested in joining, please come to one of our meetings or contact us.
